# COVID19

Exploring Coronavirus cases and deaths by state using data from the NY Times page, https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data.
I have also included an interactive ShinyApp, using Plotly, that allows users to pick between graphs depicting deaths and cases. Other features include selecting different states for comparison and subsetting dates on the x-axis.
